# Medslate AI

Our team’s members have experience working in medical environments through various roles. Throughout our time in these environments, we often noticed the issue of patients struggling to understand, or misunderstanding, what their doctor is saying. This is a tremendous issue and one that causes confusion and harm to countless patients every year. Inspired to tackle the problem, and improve the lives of patients and medical professionals, we decided to create Medslate.

# What it does

Medslate is intended to be used during appointments by either a medical professional or a patient. During the meeting, Medslate will record the conversation between the doctor and patient to produce a transcript. After the recording is complete, users can produce a “Medslation” with three central parts: A simplified description of the transcript, key points from the appointment given in simple language, and clarification questions that the patient may find helpful to ask or for the doctor to address.

This project was developed for HopHacks 2023, where it received the Bloomberg Most Philanthropic Hack award!
